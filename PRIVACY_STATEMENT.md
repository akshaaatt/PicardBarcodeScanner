## Data processing and storage

Picard Barcode Scanner does not store or process any personal data nor does it
make personal data available to any third party. In particular Picard Barcode
Scanner does not gather any personal data, does not perform any user analytics
or user tracking and does not make any personal data available to third-parties

## Permissions

**Camera:** Picard Barcode Scanner needs access to your device's camera in order
to detect and scan EAN or UPC product barcodes. The camera image is only used
for barcode detection and for reading the actual barcode number from it. The
image itself is not permanently stored on your device and is not submitted to
any external service.

**Internet:** Picard Barcode Scanner needs internet access to search for releases
matching the scanned barcode in the [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org)
database. For the search only the scanned barcode number is being submitted
to MusicBrainz, no personal data is being submitted and no account on
MusicBrainz is required.

MusicBrainz is an open, community managed music database, which
makes all data available under free and open licenses. MusicBrainz is operated
by the [MetaBrainz Foundation](https://metabrainz.org/), a California based
501(c)(3) tax-exempt non-profit corporation dedicated to keeping MusicBrainz

have any questions on the data usage of the MusicBrainz service.
